                            <p>I have always been attracted to visual stimulants - color, shape and pattern leave me mesmerized. The difference between design and art is that an artist creates works to express ideas and provoke reactions. A designer creates functional solutions that address the needs. I like to solve problems and make things better with my skills. It also helps that visual design emphasizes messaging and storytelling, with wide applications across media and platforms.</p>

                            <h3>The significant things that designers do</h3>
                            <p>A few years into working as a designer, I started to realize that the power to publish and communicate is the true reason I love this line of work. Publications in forms of web, digital and print have been helping people acquire information for centuries. Civil liberties such as the free press and freedom of expressions are important mechanisms in a society with checks and balances. They are even more imperative nowadays with the rise of misinformation and propaganda campaigns.

Letting live take me to places, with a touch of spontaneity, is my secret to happiness. I want to better understand the meaning of life and the significance of my own existence.

                            <p>Unfortunately I don't do letterpress printing but I want to make a point that technology and design are closely tied together. I use paper and pencil a lot. When I work by myself I use InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. In an agency environment I mostly use Sketch + Invision DSM. For coding HTML / CSS, a simple code editor is usually enough. Adobe Animate helps me with short animated stuff.

                            <p>Like most properly trained designers, I take care of web, mobile and print projects. Over time there have been titles such as graphic / digital / communication designer for those professionals in my line of work, with specialized designers titled web / UI, user interface / interaction designer.</p>

                            <p>Many of my projects cover web, interface and print - the concepts and visuals can adapt to many platforms. A campaign may deploy many spin-offs or marketing collateral in forms like webpages, social media ads and print materials. The core design principles remain the same, and the solutions are adapted to the characteristics of the medium.
