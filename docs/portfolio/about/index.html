                    <p>Designers have always been a part of the social and cultural movements. Ruth Bader Ginsburg used to say "if you want to be a true professional, do something outside yourself - make things better for those who are less fortunate than you". I never doubt it.</p>

                            <p>I'm attracted to visual stimulants - color, shape, and content leave me mesmerized. A designer creates functional solutions that address the needs. This allows me to solve problems and make things better with my skills. Visual design emphasizes messaging and storytelling, with wide applications across media and platforms. Some pieces express ideas and provoke reactions, examining our culture and society. Doing this makes me feel connected to the place I live.</p>

                            <h3>The significant things that designers do</h3>
                            <p>A few years into working as a designer, I started to realize that the power to publish and communicate is the true reason I love this line of work. Publications in forms of web, digital and print have been helping people acquire information for centuries. Civil liberties such as the free press &amp; expression are important mechanisms in a society with checks and balances. They are even more imperative nowadays with the rise of misinformation and propaganda campaigns.

                            <p>Regardless of the latest tools available, I use pencil, paper and moodboards a lot - they help me organize my thoughts and brainstorm. I design with interface based softwares such as Figma, Photoshop, Indesign and Illustrator. Markup languages like HTML/CSS enable me to prototype and explore the design. Generative AI tools give me access to information, ideas and new skills, broadening my research and ideation process.

                            <p>Like most trained designers, I have experience with screen and print based projects. Before the rise of the tech sector, there were titles like graphic / digital / communication designers for those professionals in my line of work. Nowadays there are more intricate specialities such as web / interaction / UI / UX / product design.</p>

                            <p>I have worked with a variety of designers and my observation is that there are lots of overlapped responsibilities and skills, but a visual designer primarily focuses on the interface and visual identity of a product. I also specialize in interaction and web product design.
